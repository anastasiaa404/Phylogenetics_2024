# HW1: “Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?”.
*Phylogenetics, human evolution.*
- Calculations of tree and age of mitochondrial Eve are presented separately in files: (https://github.com/anastasiaa404/Phylogenetics_2024/blob/main/HW1/Age_Eva.ipynb, https://github.com/anastasiaa404/Phylogenetics_2024/blob/main/HW1/HW1_Human.ipynb).

## 1. The resulting phylogenetic tree:

## 2. Estimating the age of mitochondrial Eve.
Having calculated the age of mitochondrial Eve, I came to these results: 
- Maximum number of mutations: 96 (sequence KX440262.1).
- Estimated age of mitochondrial Eve: 144000 years.
These results are approximate because many other factors were not taken into account. In third-party sources the age of Eve is predicted in the range of 100-200 thousand years, then we can say that my results fall within this range. 

## 3. Estimating the separation time and branching order of the Neanderthal and Denisovan populations.
Using the same method as for mitochondrial Eve, I calculated the age of the most recent common ancestor of modern humans and Neanderthal. Here are the results:
- Evolutionary distance between Neanderthals and Denisovans: 0.027373280700000002.
- Number of mutations between Neanderthal and Denisovan: 362.
- Estimated time of separation between Neanderthals and Denisovans: 543000 years.
Compared to information from the internet, the result is not quite, but similar to the truth.
